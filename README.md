## Hey there! 👋  
I'm **Luis Loor** an aspiring software developer from the heart of the world — **Ecuador 🇪🇨**.

🚀 I'm currently leveling up my coding skills, one line at a time.  
💡 I’m passionate about building web applications that solve real problems and make life a bit easier.

🎯 My next big goal? Gaining hands-on experience by collaborating with awesome people in the IT industry.

🌍 Someday, I see myself as a **digital nomad**, writing code from a beach, a mountain, or a cozy café — wherever inspiration strikes.
